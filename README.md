## Recent master's graduate with a concentration in operations research and data analytics
- I started coding in Python and R as an undergraduate at the United States Naval Academy
- I developed greater competence as a graduate student at the Naval Postgraduate School
- I am now looking to apply my academic knowledge in economics, operations research, and data analytics to problems faced by military, government, and private sector leaders
